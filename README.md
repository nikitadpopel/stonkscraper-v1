This was created by Danila Popel and Nikita Popel. This project was originally created on December 20th, 2020.
This project creates a terminal based stock market scraper that let's you check current stock prices and historical stock prices. This is v1.0 of the project and we intend to further elaborate on this design.
In v2.0, we plan on implementing a GUI through using tkinter and matplotlib
In v3.0, we plan on adding further functionality to the program by become a sort of stock simulating game, allowing the user to invest fake money and cash in on fake dividends every quarter and reinvest their funds.
